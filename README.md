# Interactive rating component with React and Tailwind

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). 

A simple and clean **React** component for collecting user ratings. It utilizes **Tailwind CSS** to style the interface, providing a great user experience. 

The component uses a functional component structure, using hooks to manage the component state. The component makes use of two sub-components SelectRating and SelectedRating to handle the different states of the component. The styles applied to the component are done with the use of **Tailwind CSS** classes, which makes it easy to customize the look and feel.

**NOTE: The component itself is in `rating-component/src/components` folder**
